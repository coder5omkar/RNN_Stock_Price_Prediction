Stock Price Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Repository Description
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of stock price prediction models using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically SimpleRNN and LSTM architectures. 
The project focuses on predicting closing prices for four major technology stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), and Microsoft (MSFT).
